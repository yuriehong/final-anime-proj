r2 = Review.create!(rating: 9, comment: "This anime is really fun to watch, you may think that it is only about a little kid trying to find his dad, but it gets a lot deeper than that. I think this anime should be as popular as One piece, Naruto or Bleach. I don't think there is one single episode in hunter x Hunter where I was bored. The best thing is that this anime has no fillers at all.", anime_id:a2.id, user_id: u1.id)
r3 = Review.create!(rating: 10, comment:"I don't write these. this is my first, this show is a gift from the anime gods. it is perfection. not an opinion. a fact. 8 episodes in and they are all flawless. except the fact i want more of them. The Plot effortlessly moves between powerful, creepy, hilarious, and emotional. You love the characters. You are invested. Animation is honestly so gorgeous it ruins other animes for me a bit.", anime_id:a3.id, user_id: u1.id)
r4 = Review.create!(rating: 7, comment: "Unique and funny characters, mystery, action, a wonderful story, and a bunch of hidden lore. This anime will keep you on the edge of your seat and make 1 episode seem like 5 minutes have just passed by. It's different as it throws you in without knowing anything about their world. You figure things out along the way. The soundtrack is also fantastic. Although, they changed and left out some scenes from the webtoon. Which is definitely also worth the read.", anime_id:a4.id, user_id: u2.id)

I can not get enough of this super awesome anime!!! Great job to the people who made this. Thank you so much!", anime_id:a5.id, user_id: u2.id)
